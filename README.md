comfy-cli is a command line tool that helps users easily install and manage
[ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI), a powerful open-source
machine learning framework. With comfy-cli, you can quickly set up ComfyUI,
install packages, and manage custom nodes, all from the convenience of your
terminal.

## Installation

1. (Recommended, but not necessary) Enable virtual environment ([venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)/[conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html))

2. To install comfy-cli, make sure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed on your system. Then, run the following command:

   `pip install comfy-cli`

### Shell Autocomplete

To install autocompletion hints in your shell run:

`comfy --install-completion`

This enables you to type `comfy [TAP]` to autocomplete commands and options

## Usage

### Installing ComfyUI

To install ComfyUI using comfy, simply run:

`comfy install`

This command will download and set up the latest version of ComfyUI and ComfyUI-Manager on your
system. If you run in a ComfyUI repo that has already been setup. The command
will simply update the comfy.yaml file to reflect the local setup

- `comfy install --skip-manager`: Install ComfyUI without ComfyUI-Manager.
- `comfy --workspace=<path> install`: Install ComfyUI into `<path>/ComfyUI`.
- For `comfy install`, if no path specification like `--workspace, --recent, or --here` is provided, it will be implicitly installed in `<HOME>/comfy`.

### Specifying execution path

- You can specify the path of ComfyUI where the command will be applied through path indicators as follows:
  - `comfy --workspace=<path>`: Run from the ComfyUI installed in the specified workspace.
  - `comfy --recent`: Run from the recently executed or installed ComfyUI.
  - `comfy --here`: Run from the ComfyUI located in the current directory.
- --workspace, --recent, and --here options cannot be used simultaneously.
- If there is no path indicator, the following priority applies:

  - Run from the default ComfyUI at the path specified by `comfy set-default <path>`.
  - Run from the recently executed or installed ComfyUI.
  - Run from the ComfyUI located in the current directory.

- Example 1: To run the recently executed ComfyUI:
  - `comfy --recent launch`
- Example 2: To install a package on the ComfyUI in the current directory:
  - `comfy --here node install ComfyUI-Impact-Pack`
- Example 3: To update the automatically selected path of ComfyUI and custom nodes based on priority:

  - `comfy node update all`

- You can use the `comfy which` command to check the path of the target workspace.
  - e.g `comfy --recent which`, `comfy --here which`, `comfy which`, ...

### Default Setup

The default sets the option that will be executed by default when no specific workspace's ComfyUI has been set for the command.

`comfy set-default <workspace path> ?[--launch-extras="<extra args>"]`

- `--launch-extras` option specifies extra args that are applied only during launch by default. However, if extras are specified at the time of launch, this setting is ignored.

### Launch ComfyUI

Comfy provides commands that allow you to easily run the installed ComfyUI.

`comfy launch`

- To run with default ComfyUI options:

  `comfy launch -- <extra args...>`

  `comfy launch -- --cpu --listen 0.0.0.0`

  - When you manually configure the extra options, the extras set by set-default will be overridden.

- To run background

  `comfy launch --background`

  `comfy --workspace=~/comfy launch --background -- --listen 10.0.0.10 --port 8000`

  - Instances launched with `--background` are displayed in the "Background ComfyUI" section of `comfy env`, providing management functionalities for a single background instance only.
  - Since "Comfy Server Running" in `comfy env` only shows the default port 8188, it doesn't display ComfyUI running on a different port.
  - Background-running ComfyUI can be stopped with `comfy stop`.

### Managing Custom Nodes

comfy provides a convenient way to manage custom nodes for extending ComfyUI's functionality. Here are some examples:

- Show custom nodes' information:

```
comfy node [show|simple-show] [installed|enabled|not-installed|disabled|all|snapshot|snapshot-list]
                             ?[--channel <channel name>]
                             ?[--mode [remote|local|cache]]
```

- `comfy node show all --channel recent`

  `comfy node simple-show installed`

  `comfy node update all`

  `comfy node install ComfyUI-Impact-Pack`

- Managing snapshot:

  `comfy node save-snapshot`

  `comfy node restore-snapshot <snapshot name>`

- Install dependencies:

  `comfy node install-deps --deps=<deps .json file>`

  `comfy node install-deps --workflow=<workflow .json/.png file>`

- Generate deps:

  `comfy node deps-in-workflow --workflow=<workflow .json/.png file>`

### Managing Models

- Model downloading

  `comfy model download --url <URL> ?[--relative-path <PATH>] ?[--set-civitai-api-token <TOKEN>]`

  * URL: CivitAI, huggingface file url, ...

- Model remove

  `comfy model remove ?[--relative-path <PATH>] --model-names <model names>`

- Model list

  `comfy model list ?[--relative-path <PATH>]`

### Managing ComfyUI-Manager

- disable GUI of ComfyUI-Manager (disable Manager menu and Server)

  `comfy manager disable-gui`

- enable GUI of ComfyUI-Manager

  `comfy manager enable-gui`

- Clear reserved startup action:

  `comfy manager clear`
